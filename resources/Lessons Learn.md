## Admin issues:
1. [jgoh] Creating branch though Github using "git checkout -b name". This should allow us to push work up to origin. Steps:
  - git checkout -b name
  - git add -A
  - git commit -m ".."
  - git push origin name

2. [jgoh] Always create branch instead of updating direct to master. Direct updating by team to master is possible so might be missed by originator.
