Organize city images based on (hidden) temperatures 

## About

Five images will be presented to the user randomly from a list of 20 possible cities. The user will need to order them by coldest to warmest. They will have a limited number of tries to get it correct. Current temperatures will be obtained via a weather API. General information about each city will be provided by a wiki API and available to the user via an additional information button.
